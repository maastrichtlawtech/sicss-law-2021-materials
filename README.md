2. **R Cheatsheets**: Small collection of R cheatsheets. Visit the [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page for more
    - **[Data Import Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/data-import.pdf)**: how to read data, work with the results, and reshape messy data with tidyr. Use  tidyr to reshape your tables into tidy data, the data format that works the most seamlessly with R and the tidyverse. 
    - **[Data Transformation Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf)**: dplyr provides a grammar for manipulating tables in R. This cheatsheet will guide you through the grammar, reminding you how to select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarise, group, and join data frames and tibbles. 
    - **[Data Visualization Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)**: The ggplot2 package lets you make beautiful and customizable plots of your data. It implements the grammar of graphics, an easy to use system for building plots. 
    - **[Work with Strings Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/strings.pdf)**: The stringr package provides an easy to use toolkit for working with strings, i.e. character data, in R. This cheatsheet guides you through stringr’s functions for manipulating strings. The back page provides a concise reference to regular expresssions, a mini-language for describing, finding, and matching patterns in strings. 
    - **[Dates and Times Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/times-and-dates.pdf)**: Lubridate makes it easier to work with dates and times in R. This lubridate cheatsheet covers how to round dates, work with time zones, extract elements of a date or time, parse dates into R and more. The back of the cheatsheet describes lubridate’s three timespan classes: periods, durations, and intervals; and explains how to do math with date-times.
